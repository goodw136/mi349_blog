            <h2>Why I Started My Blog</h2>

                It all began when I decided I wanted to take a Web Design course. It made sense to me: I really enjoyed Web Design when I took 
                it in high school, so it followed that I would enjoy it here too. Thankfully, the course has been pretty fun so far, though I was
                initially curious as to why we chose a blog of all things. As it turns out, the data doesn't lie: blogs are among the most 
                high-traffic kinds of website around.
            </p>
            <table>
                <caption>
                    Different website types ranked by traffic according to fictitiousdata.org
                </caption>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope = "col">Website Type</th>
                        <th scope = "col">Yearly Traffic (in millions of visits)</th>
                        <th scope = "col">Ranking</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope = "row">Social Media Websites</th>

                        <th>2</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope = "row">Blogs</th>
                        <th>309.6</th>
                        <th>3</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th scope = "row">Browser Game Websites</th>
                        <th>263.1</th>
                        <th>6</th>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                As shown by the table, blogs rank among the top 3 most visited types of website on the Internet, making them an important
                backbone of the user experience. As such, blogs are not only a fun way to talk about your life and express your feelings, but
                they can also be a great way to bring people into your website. With that in mind, I elected to make this blog not just because
                I was required to for my school work, but because it would be a fun and interesting way to express myself and potentially create
                something that resonates with others. With all that established, I hope you enjoyed my first ever post on Goodwin's Blog, and
                you're ready to read on for the many posts I plan to write in the future!

            <h2>One Game A Month</h2>
            <h3>by John Goodwin</h3>
            <h5>Published 9/26/2025</h5>
            <p>
                Anyone who's played video games before knows the feeling of having an enormous backlog. There are so many games you want to
                play but there's simply too many to choose from, leading to your list becoming longer and longer until eventually half your
                library is filled with games you never play. I saw this becoming a problem and decided to try a new way to put myself out
                of my comfort zone: the "Game of the Month" formula. The premise was quite simple: I would pick one game that would become
                my project for that month. I first began this concept with a game called Persona 5, as a friend of mine had recommended it
                for quite some time.

                I managed to complete it by February, and I continued with this trend all the way until this month. Unfortunately, my
                schedule simply became too busy to continue doing it in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally, my motivation to keep
                going had hit rock bottom, and as such it began to feel like I was forcing myself to do something I didn't want to do.
                It was then that I really learned something: no matter how much you enjoy something, it's never any fun once you're forcing
                yourself to do it. As such, I feel much more content allowing this idea to remain in the past: although it was a fun and
                useful way to motivate me to step out of my comfort zone, it has since surpassed its purpose and I now choose to take
                my games at my own pace as I choose to play them.
