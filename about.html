    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is John Goodwin and I'm the person behind this blog. I'm a 20 year old Computer Science student at MSU, meaning
        I'm open to basically anything that involves coding. I've also a big fan of video games ever since I was a kid, when my family
        got a Nintendo Wii. Some of my favorite franchises include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pokemon (especially the Mystery Dungeon games)</li>
        <li>Ace Attorney</li>
        <li>Metroid</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        ... among many others. I've also been a lifelong animal lover, owning several pets over the years. Currently, we have two 
        cockapoos named TJ and Chase (seen below), though we also had a dachshund named Tootsie, a greyhound named Benny and a cat named Mei Mei
        over the years.

        With all that said, I hope you enjoy my blog and all of its stories!
